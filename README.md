# Lab 2: Modules and Testing

I this lab, I created the first function called *fibonacci* with only one parameter n.

The function will return the nth value in the fibonacci series.

Added another function called *lucas* that returns the nth value in the lucas numbers. This one also have one parameter n.

The third function added here is called *sum_series* with one required parameter and two optional parameters.

The required parameter in the sum_series function will determine which element in the series to print and the two optional parameters will have default values of 0 and 1 and will determine the first two values for the series to be produced.

Calling the sum_series function with no optional parameters will produce numbers from the fibonacci series.

Calling it with the optional arguments 2 and 1 will produce values from the lucas numbers.

And other values for the optional parameters will produce other series.

**Note that, according to the TDD guidance, I wrote the test cases for all the three functions before going to the code**

Would like to thank My TA Hexx King for helping me on this assignment.
